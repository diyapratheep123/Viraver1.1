# Elsa 1.1
Elsa is a personal assistant in development that hosts a variety of features like opening up pretty much any file from your system,searching the web,running programs etc.
<br>
The aim of Elsa is to use your computer as productive as possible by using your keyboard and thus saving the valuable time you use to search things here and there
<br>
For Elsa to work,you require a package called <b><u>magicForElsa</b></u>.....
<br>
The package is pretty powerful that without that Elsa won't even load up.
<br>
<b>Hope that this program is a teeny tiny bit useful for u.</b>

### Requirements:
- A computer running Windows (preferably Windows 10) with python 3 (preferably 3.9) installed.
- magicForElsa to be installed from pypi using `pip install magicForElsa`.
- It is highly preferable that the default browser is firefox.

### Installation
-   Just run the `Elsa ver_1_1.py` in  the repo after installing `magicForElsa`
### Usage
